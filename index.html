                                (1600 GMT), with the probe set to reach Jupiter’s moon Europa in five and a half years.

                                NASA later confirmed that it had successfully acquired a signal from the probe and that
                                its massive solar arrays — designed to capture the weak light that reaches Jupiter — had
                                fully unfolded.

                                The mission will allow the US space agency to uncover new details about Europa, which
                                scientists believe could hold an ocean beneath its icy surface.

                                ‘With Europa Clipper, we’re not searching for life on Europa, but we’re trying to see if
                                this ocean world is habitable, and that means we’re looking for the water,’ NASA
                                official Gina DiBraccio said ahead of the launch.

                            year-on-year to 1.53 billion euros, up from 1.43 billion euros in the same period of 2023,
                            driven largely by knitwear, while woven garments posted slightly slower growth.

                                However, Bangladesh’s apparel exports to the EU declined by 2.47 per cent to 13.43
                                billion euros in January-September of 2024, down from 13.77 billion euros in the same
                                period of 2023, due to significant drops in January, February and March, according to
                                data from Eurostat, the statistical office of the EU.
                                <br> <br>
                                The overall apparel imports by the EU from different countries in the first nine months
                                of 2024 decreased by 2.28 per cent to 62.86 billion euros from 64.46 billion euros in
                                the same period of the previous year.
                                <br> <br>
                                The data revealed that, during the period, the EU’s apparel imports from nearly all
                                major supplier countries experienced negative growth, with the exception of that from
                                Pakistan.

                                ‘While global demand has been improving in recent months, Bangladesh is struggling to
                                fully capitalise on the opportunity due to eroding competitive advantages, primarily
                                caused by high utility prices, inadequate gas supply and the recent wage hike,’ said
                                former Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association president Fazlul

                                At the heart of the Xiaomi Redmi 14C is its 6.88-inch HD+ Dot Drop display, offering a
                                1640x720 resolution and a pixel density of 260 PPI. Most notably, the display supports a
                                120Hz refresh rate, ensuring ultra-smooth scrolling and responsiveness, ideal for
                                gaming, video playback, and browsing. <br> <br>
                                This high refresh rate significantly enhances the user experience by providing fluid
                                motion without lag, especially during high-action gaming or dynamic visual content.
                                <br> <br>
                                The touch sampling rate of 240Hz further improves the responsiveness, making every
                                interaction feel instantaneous. With a screen brightness of 450 nits (typical) and 600
                                nits HBM (High Brightness Mode), users can enjoy vibrant visuals even under direct
                                sunlight.
                                <br> <br>
                                It’s not just the performance of the phone that’s worth talking about, but the design
                                too. Available in three eye-catching colours—Midnight Black, Dreamy Purple, and Starry
                                Blue—the Xiaomi Redmi 14C exudes elegance. Each shade has been crafted to enhance the
                                phone’s aesthetics, with a unique star trail pattern on the back that adds a subtle yet
                                sophisticated touch to the overall design.

                                Lifelong Roma fan Ranieri said after he was hired last week that he has “no time for
                                mistakes” as he attempts to salvage something from a season which looks as good as over.

                                Roma head to Napoli in 12th, four points above the relegation zone after four defeats in
                                five league matches under Ranieri’s predecessor Ivan Juric, who was sacked following a
                                home loss at the hands of Bologna before the international break.

                                But while a drop to Serie B is unlikely given the quality of the squad and Ranieri’s
                                experience, Roma are already 12 points away from the Champions League positions which
                                are a key objective of the billionaire Friedkin family who own the club and have been
                                the target of supporter ire.

                                Roma haven’t qualified for Europe’s elite club competition since 2018 and fans were
                                outraged by the sacking of idol Daniele De Rossi in September, after he was given a
                                three-year contract only a few months before.
